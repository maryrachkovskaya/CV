# Information: #
For the last 5 years, I have worked in the field of edtech and beauty. I had teams of up to 10 people under my command, and my responsibilities included everything from hiring employees and writing job descriptions to detailed financial statements. Over time, the focus of attention shifted more and more towards QA.
I have experience of website testing (a new company project), during which I conducted user interface and web forms testing, GUI testing, and wrote bug reports.
